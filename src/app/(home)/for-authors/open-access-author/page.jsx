        According to important definitions of open access found in the academic
        literature (namely the Budapest, Berlin, and Bethesda declarations), the
        following criteria are used by Dream Science to define open access:
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no subscription requirements or price restrictions for
        peer-reviewed publications. Instantaneous publication of literature in
        open access format (no embargo period). If the original publication is
        correctly cited, published material may be reused without requesting
        permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Reproduction for nonprofit purposes is allowed." Dream Science
        International Journals began employing the most recent CC BY-NC-ND 4.0
        licence, which gives writers the broadest rights, as of 2014 when they
        first began publishing articles under the Creative Commons Attribution
        License external link.
      </p>
      <p>
        This entails that all articles published in Dream Science International
        Journals, including data, graphics, and supplements, may be freely
        linked from outside sources, scanned by search engines, or reused by
        text mining programmes or websites, blogs, etc., subject only to the
        requirement that the source and original publisher be properly
        acknowledged. According to Dream Science, open access publication
        encourages the sharing of research findings among scientists from other
        fields, hence encouraging interdisciplinary research. Additionally, open
        access publication makes study findings available to all academics,
        especially those in underdeveloped nations and the general public.
        Despite the fact that Dream Science publishes all of its journals using
        the open-access model, we think that open access is a valuable component
        of the academic communication process that can and should coexist
        alongside other models.

        <b>Important Note:</b> Some articles, especially reviews, may use text,
        figures, or tables that were previously published elsewhere for which
        Dream Science does not possess the copyright or authority to re-license
        the work. Please take notice that the original author should be
        consulted before the new author decides whether to utilise this
        information.

        likely to incorporate open access journals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The greater visibility and accessibility of open access papers
        contributes to their higher citation impact. There is evidence that open
        access articles receive higher citations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lower Publishing Charges: Open access publishers charge authors'
        institutions or research funding organisations to pay their costs for
        editorial handling and editing a manuscript.
      </p>
      <p>
        By only being available online, Dream Science's open access journals can
        publish articles more quickly.
