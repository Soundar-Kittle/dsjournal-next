        Publication Ethics
      </h1>
      <p>
        In order to ensure high-quality scientific publications, public
        confidence in scientific findings, and that people have been given
        credit for their contributions, there are ethical standards for
        publication. Dream Science aspires to follow the COPEâ€™s Code of Conduct
        and Best Practice Guidelines for Publication Ethics.
