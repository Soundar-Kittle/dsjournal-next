      <h6>Online Corrections</h6>
      <p>
        The final and complete version of an article is the one that is posted
        online. Although it is feasible to correct this version, it is against
        our policy (and that of other publishers) to do so unless absolutely
        necessary. Typographical mistakes may only be fixed in the following
        areas: author names, affiliations, paper titles, abstracts, and
        keywords. In these situations, it would also be essential to issue an
        erratum or corrigendum (see below), so that there would be a record to
        document the discrepancy between the online and print versions.

      <h6>Errata</h6>
      <p>
        If a significant error was made during the production of the journal
        article (one that has an impact on the record of publications, the
        scientific integrity of the paper, the reputation of the authors, or the
        reputation of the journal), an erratum will be used. This includes
        errors of omission like failing to make factual proof corrections
        requested by authors by the journal within the deadline provided by the
        journal and in accordance with journal policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except in cases when a seemingly little error has a severe impact, we do
        not post errata for typing errors (for example, an incorrect unit). An
        erratum is a fresh corrected figure or table that is published when a
        serious mistake in a figure or table has been discovered. Only if the
        editor deems it essential will the figure or table be reposted.
      </p>
      <h6>Corrigenda</h6>
      <p>
        A corrigendum is a statement that the writers of the article committed a
        significant error. To be published, corrigenda must be signed by all
        writers. When co-authors disagree, the editors will implement the
        necessary adjustment on the recommendation of independent
        peer-reviewers, mentioning the dissenting author(s) in the text of the
        published edition.
      </p>
      <h6>Addenda</h6>
      <p>
        An addendum serves as notice that material has been peer-reviewed added
        to a document, maybe in response to a reader's clarification request.
        Addenda do not change the content of the original publication, but they
        may be added if the author unintentionally left out important
        information that was at the time accessible. Rarely, and only when the
        editors determine that the addendum is essential to the reader's
        comprehension of a sizable portion of the original contribution, are
        addenda published.
