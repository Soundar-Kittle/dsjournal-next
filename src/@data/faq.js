      `In the case of subscription-based journals, readers who discover an article via a repository search cannot read the paper in full unless they have a subscription. However, as Dream Science only publishes Open Access content, we work closely with the various database providers to ensure that the full text of your papers is made available through the leading abstracting and indexing services. This helps to ensure that your work can be read, used, and cited by the widest possible audience. While many people read your work on dsjournal.com, many more access and read it in their preferred environment.`,

        <li>
          <b>Will my manuscript remain confidential?</b>
          <p>
            Yes. Dream Science treats all submitted manuscripts as confidential documents. Dream Science also instructs and expects our Board of Reviewing Editors and reviewers to treat manuscripts as confidential material. Our peer review process is confidential, and the reviewers' identities are not released. (Letters and Technical Comments are sent to the authors of papers on which they comment for response or rebuttal but are treated the same way as other contributions concerning confidentiality.)

        <li>
          <b>What's the policy on prior publication of results?</b>
          <p>
            Dream Science will only consider research papers reporting primary data and the main conclusions for the first time. Your cover letter should clarify how the Dream Science submission is original. Any related manuscript under consideration or accepted in another journal but not yet published by any author on the manuscript should be included with your submission or revision so it can be uploaded as an auxiliary file. The Discovery of a related paper by any author that is not disclosed may cause immediate rejection without appeal or editorial retraction after publication.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>What about manuscripts that have been posted online before submission?</b>
          <p>
            We do not consider manuscripts that have been previously published elsewhere. Posting a paper on the Internet may be considered prior publication that could compromise the originality of the Science submission. However, we allow posting on arxiv.org and, in many cases, on other not-for-profit preprint servers. Please get in touch with the editors for advice about specific cases.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>What's the policy on the publication of data sets?</b>
          <p>
            As a condition of publication, authors must agree to make available all data necessary to understand and assess the manuscript's conclusions to any Dream Science reader. Data must be included in the body of the paper or in the supplementary materials, where they can be viewed free of charge by all visitors to the site. Certain data types must be deposited in an approved online database, including DNA and protein sequences, microarray data, crystal nmr, electron microscopy structures, and climate records. The accession numbers must be included in the published paper, and coordinates must be released at the time of publication.
